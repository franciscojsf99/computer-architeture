NAME
       texi2dvi4a2ps  -  Compile Texinfo and LaTeX files to DVI
       or PDF

SYNOPSIS
       texi2dvi4a2ps [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Run each Texinfo or LaTeX FILE through TeX in turn until
       all cross-references are resolved, building all indices.
       The directory  containing  each  FILE  is  searched  for
       included files.  The suffix of FILE is used to determine
       its language (LaTeX or Texinfo).

       Makeinfo is used  to  perform  Texinfo  macro  expansion
       before running TeX when needed.

   Operation modes:
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit successfully

       -v, --version
              display version information and exit successfully

       -V, --verbose
              report on what is done

       -q, --quiet
              no output unless errors (implies --batch)

       -s, --silent
              same as --quiet

       -D, --debug
              turn on shell debugging (set -x)

       -b, --batch
              no interaction

       -c, --clean
              remove all auxiliary files

       -o, --output=FILE
              leave output in FILE (implies --clean)

       Only one FILE may be specified if `--output' is used.

   TeX tuning:
       -@     use @input instead of \input; for preloaded  Tex-
              info

       -e, --expand
              force macro expansion using makeinfo

       -I DIR search DIR for Texinfo files

       -l, --language=LANG
              specify the LANG of FILE (LaTeX or Texinfo)

       -p, --pdf
              use pdftex or pdflatex for processing

       -t, --texinfo=CMD
              insert  CMD  after  @setfilename in copy of input
              file multiple values accumulate

       The values of the BIBTEX, LATEX (or  PDFLATEX),  MAKEIN-
       DEX, MAKEINFO, TEX (or PDFTEX), and TEXINDEX environment
       variables are used to run those commands,  if  they  are
       set.

SEE ALSO
       texi2dvi4a2ps is exactly the same  script  as  texi2dvi,
       part  of  the  package  GNU Texinfo.  It is used by a2ps
       when delegating LaTeX and  Texinfo  files.   Instead  of
       checking  whether  the  version  of  texi2dvi  which  is
       installed is recent enough, it is  more  convenient  for
       the  users  that  a2ps  is  shipped  with the version of
       texi2dvi  it  requires.   a2ps(1),  card(1),   fixps(1),
       pdiff(1), psset(1), texi2dvi4a2ps(1).

       The  full  documentation for texi2dvi is maintained as a
       Texinfo manual.  If the info and texi2dvi  programs  are
       properly installed at your site, the command

              info texi2dvi

       should give you access to the complete manual.
